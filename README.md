Functionality working:

- We will be able to see all the countries flags arranged vertically.
- On clicking each flag, we should see the country name on the top.
- Just below the country name, we should be able to see the list of the cities as well for the country.
- In each city entry, we have the city object which refernces to the Network object itself and so we can further display more data using that object.
